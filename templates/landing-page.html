                                Amazing news for the most famous DnD YouTube channel Critical Role comes at the heels of an original plan of just making a 10-episode season. In other words, Amazon was so impressed with them on Twitch, that
                                it decided to animate Critical Role: The Legend of Vox Machina for the span of 2 seasons – that’s 24 episodes in total.

                                In a video recently released by Wired, Joe Manganiello takes on the internet’s questions about Dungeons & Dragons, putting his expertise as a dungeon master to use in a supremely entertaining fashion.
                                Manganiello clearly has a lot of passion about the subject, and he talks knowledgeably about his experiences with the game and how fans might get into it for the first time or enhance their ongoing
                                experience.

                                Chris Pine is in talks to star in Paramount's long-awaited Dungeons & Dragons movie. Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley are set to direct the project, which they claim will be a fun and fresh approach.
                                Goldstein previously said, "We want it to be fun. It's not an out and out comedy, but it is an action-fantasy movie with a lot of comedic elements and characters we hope people will really get into and enjoy
                                watching their adventures." It seems that the directing duo were able to convince Pine to get it in on the fun.
