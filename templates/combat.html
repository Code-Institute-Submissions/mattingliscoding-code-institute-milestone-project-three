    <h1 class="fancy-font">Combat</h1>
    <p>
        A typical combat encounter is a clash between two sides, a flurry of weapon swings, feints, parries, footwork,
        and spellcasting. The game organizes the chaos of combat into a cycle of rounds and turns. A round represents
        about 6 seconds in the game world. During a round, each participant in a battle takes a turn. The order of turns
        is determined at the beginning of a combat encounter, when everyone rolls initiative. Once everyone has taken a
        turn, the fight continues to the next round if neither side has defeated the other.
    </p>
    <h4 class="strong">Combat Step by Step</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Determine surprise.</strong> The GM determines whether anyone involved in the combat encounter is
            surprised.</li>
        <li>
            <strong>Establish positions.</strong> The GM decides where all the characters and monsters are located.
            Given the adventurers' marching order or their stated positions in the room or other location, the GM
            figures out
            where the adversaries areÌ¶how far away and in what direction.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Roll initiative.</strong> Everyone involved in the combat encounter rolls initiative, determining
            the order of combatants' turns.</li>
        <li><strong>Take turns.</strong> Each participant in the battle takes a turn in initiative order.</li>
        <li><strong>Begin the next round.</strong> When everyone involved in the combat has had a turn, the round ends.
            Repeat step 4 until the fighting stops.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4 class="strong">Surprise</h4>
    <p>
        A band of adventurers sneaks up on a bandit camp, springing from the trees to attack them. A gelatinous cube
        glides down a dungeon passage, unnoticed by the adventurers until the cube engulfs one of them. In these
        situations, one side of the battle gains surprise over the other.
    </p>
    <p>
        The GM determines who might be surprised. If neither side tries to be stealthy, they automatically notice each
        other. Otherwise, the GM compares the Dexterity (Stealth) checks of anyone hiding with the passive Wisdom
        (Perception) score of each creature on the opposing side. Any character or monster that doesn't notice a threat
        is surprised at the start of the encounter.
    </p>
    <p>If you're surprised, you can't move or take an action on your first turn of the combat, and you can't take a
        reaction until that turn ends. A member of a group can be surprised even if the other members aren't.</p>
    <h4 class="strong">Initiative</h4>
    <p>
        Initiative determines the order of turns during combat. When combat starts, every participant makes a Dexterity
        check to determine their place in the initiative order. The GM makes one roll for an entire group of identical
        creatures, so each member of the group acts at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
        The GM ranks the combatants in order from the one with the highest Dexterity check total to the one with the
        lowest. This is the order (called the initiative order) in which they act during each round. The initiative
        order
        remains the same from round to round.
    </p>
    <p>
        If a tie occurs, the GM decides the order among tied GM-controlled creatures, and the players decide the order
        among their tied characters. The GM can decide the order if the tie is between a monster and a player character.
        Optionally, the GM can have the tied characters and monsters each roll a d20 to determine the order, highest
        roll going first.
    </p>
    <h4 class="strong">Your Turn</h4>
    <p>On your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed and take one action. You decide whether to move first or
        take your action first. Your speed- sometimes called your walking speed-is noted on your character sheet.</p>
    <p>The most common actions you can take are described in the "Actions in Combat" section later in this chapter. Many
        class features and other abilities provide additional options for your action.</p>
    <p>The "Movement and Position" section later in this chapter gives the rules for your move.</p>
    <p>You can forgo moving, taking an action, or doing anything at all on your turn. If you can't decide what to do on
        your turn, consider taking the Dodge or Ready action, as described in "Actions in Combat."</p>
    <h4 class="strong">Bonus Actions</h4>
    <p>
        Various class features, spells, and other abilities let you take an additional action on your turn called a
        bonus action. The Cunning Action feature, for example, allows a rogue to take a bonus action. You can take a
        bonus
        action only when a special ability, spell, or other feature of the game states that you can do something as a
        bonus action. You otherwise don't have a bonus action to take.
    </p>
    <p>You can take only one bonus action on your turn, so you must choose which bonus action to use when you have more
        than one available.</p>
    <p>You choose when to take a bonus action during your turn, unless the bonus action's timing is specified, and
        anything that deprives you of your ability to take actions also prevents you from taking a bonus action.</p>
    <h4 class="strong">Other Activity on Your Turn</h4>
    <p>Your turn can include a variety of flourishes that require neither your action nor your move.</p>
    <p>You can communicate however you are able, through brief utterances and gestures, as you take your turn.</p>
    <p>
        You can also interact with one object or feature of the environment for free, during either your move or your
        action. For example, you could open a door during your move as you stride toward a foe, or you could draw your
        weapon as part of the same action you use to attack.
    </p>
    <p>If you want to interact with a second object, you need to use your action. Some magic items and other special
        objects always require an action to use, as stated in their descriptions.</p>
    <p>
        The GM might require you to use an action for any of these activities when it needs special care or when it
        presents an unusual obstacle. For instance, the GM could reasonably expect you to use an action to open a stuck
        door
        or turn a crank to lower a drawbridge.
    </p>
    <h5 class="strong">Reactions</h5>
    <p>
        Certain special abilities, spells, and situations allow you to take a special action called a reaction. A
        reaction is an instant response to a trigger of some kind, which can occur on your turn or on someone else's.
        The
        opportunity attack, described later in this chapter, is the most common type of reaction.
    </p>
    <p>When you take a reaction, you can't take another one until the start of your next turn. If the reaction
        interrupts another creature's turn, that creature can continue its turn right after the reaction.</p>
    <h5 class="strong">Movement and Position</h5>
    <p>In combat, characters and monsters are in constant motion, often using movement and position to gain the upper
        hand.</p>
    <p>On your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed. You can use as much or as little of your speed as you
        like on your turn, following the rules here.</p>
    <p>
        Your movement can include jumping, climbing, and swimming. These different modes of movement can be combined
        with walking, or they can constitute your entire move. However you're moving, you deduct the distance of each
        part
        of your move from your speed until it is used up or until you are done moving.
    </p>
    <h5 class="strong">Breaking Up Your Move</h5>
    <p>You can break up your movement on your turn, using some of your speed before and after your action. For example,
        if you have a speed of 30 feet, you can move 10 feet, take your action, and then move 20 feet.</p>
    <h5 class="strong">Moving Between Attacks</h5>
    <p>
        If you take an action that includes more than one weapon attack, you can break up your movement even further by
        moving between those attacks. For example, a fighter who can make two attacks with the Extra Attack feature and
        who has a speed of 25 feet could move 10 feet, make an attack, move 15 feet, and then attack again.
    </p>
    <h5 class="strong">Using Different Speeds</h5>
    <p>
        If you have more than one speed, such as your walking speed and a flying speed, you can switch back and forth
        between your speeds during your move. Whenever you switch, subtract the distance you've already moved from the
        new
        speed. The result determines how much farther you can move. If the result is 0 or less, you can't use the new
        speed during the current move. For example, if you have a speed of 30 and a flying speed of 60 because a wizard
        cast the fly spell on you, you could fly 20 feet, then walk 10 feet, and then leap into the air to fly 30 feet
        more.
    </p>
    <h5 class="strong">Difficult Terrain</h5>
    <p>Combat rarely takes place in bare rooms or on featureless plains. Boulder-strewn caverns, briar-choked forests,
        treacherous staircases-the setting of a typical fight contains difficult terrain.</p>
    <p>Every foot of movement in difficult terrain costs 1 extra foot. This rule is true even if multiple things in a
        space count as difficult terrain.</p>
    <p>Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and shallow bogs are examples of difficult terrain. The
        space of another creature, whether hostile or not, also counts as difficult terrain.</p>
    <h5 class="strong">Being Prone</h5>
    <p>Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and shallow bogs are examples of difficult terrain. The
        space of another creature, whether hostile or not, also counts as difficult terrain.</p>
    <p>You can drop prone without using any of your speed. Standing up takes more effort; doing so costs an amount of
        movement equal to half your speed. For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend</p>
    <p>15 feet of movement to stand up. You can't stand up if you don't have enough movement left or if your speed is 0.
    </p>
    <p>To move while prone, you must crawl or use magic such as teleportation. Every foot of movement while crawling
        costs 1 extra foot. Crawling 1 foot in difficult terrain, therefore, costs 3 feet of movement.</p>
    <h5>Interacting with Objects Around You</h5>
    <p>Here are a few examples of the sorts of thing you can do in tandem with your movement and action:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>draw or sheathe a sword</li>
        <li>open or close a door</li>
        <li>withdraw a potion from your backpack</li>
        <li>pick up a dropped axe</li>
        <li>take a bauble from a table</li>
        <li>remove a ring from your finger</li>
        <li>stuff some food into your mouth</li>
        <li>plant a banner in the ground</li>
        <li>fish a few coins from your belt pouch</li>
        <li>drink all the ale in a flagon</li>
        <li>throw a lever or a switch</li>
        <li>pull a torch from a sconce</li>
        <li>take a book from a shelf you can reach</li>
        <li>extinguish a small flame</li>
        <li>don a mask</li>
        <li>pull the hood of your cloak up and over your head</li>
        <li>put your ear to a door</li>
        <li>kick a small stone</li>
        <li>turn a key in a lock</li>
        <li>tap the floor with a 10-foot pole</li>
        <li>hand an item to another character</li>
    </ul>
    <h5 class="strong">Moving Around Other Creatures</h5>
    <p>
        You can move through a nonhostile creature's space. In contrast, you can move through a hostile creature's space
        only if the creature is at least two sizes larger or smaller than you. Remember that another creature's space
        is difficult terrain for you.
    </p>
    <p>Whether a creature is a friend or an enemy, you can't willingly end your move in its space.</p>
    <p>If you leave a hostile creature's reach during your move, you provoke an opportunity attack, as explained later
        in the chapter.</p>
    <h5 class="strong">Flying Movement</h5>
    <p>
        Flying creatures enjoy many benefits of mobility, but they must also deal with the danger of falling. If a
        flying creature is knocked prone, has its speed reduced to 0, or is otherwise deprived of the ability to move,
        the
        creature falls, unless it has the ability to hover or it is being held aloft by magic, such as by the fly spell.
    </p>
    <h5 class="strong">Creature Size</h5>
    <p>Each creature takes up a different amount of space. The Size Categories table shows how much space a creature of
        a particular size controls in combat. Objects sometimes use the same size categories.</p>
    <h5 class="strong">Table - Creature Size</h5>
    <div class="table-container">
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Size</th>
                <th>Space</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Tiny</td>
                <td>2 1/2 by 2 1/2 ft.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Small</td>
                <td>5 by 5 ft.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Medium</td>
                <td>5 by 5 ft.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Large</td>
                <td>10 by 10 ft.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Huge</td>
                <td>15 by 15 ft.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Gargantuan</td>
                <td>20 by 20 ft. or larger</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </div>
    <br />
    <h5 class="strong">Space</h5>
    <p>
        A creature's space is the area in feet that it effectively controls in combat, not an expression of its physical
        dimensions. A typical Medium creature isn't 5 feet wide, for example, but it does control a space that wide. If
        a Medium hobgoblin stands in a 5-foot wide doorway, other creatures can't get through unless the hobgoblin lets
        them. A creature's space also reflects the area it needs to fight effectively. For that reason, there's a limit
        to the number of creatures that can surround another creature in combat. Assuming Medium combatants, eight
        creatures can fit in a 5-foot radius around another one. Because larger creatures take up more space, fewer of
        them
        can surround a creature. If four Large creatures crowd around a Medium or smaller one, there's little room for
        anyone else. In contrast, as many as twenty Medium creatures can surround a Gargantuan one.
    </p>
    <h5 class="strong">Squeezing into a Smaller Space</h5>
    <p>
        A creature can squeeze through a space that is large enough for a creature one size smaller than it. Thus, a
        Large creature can squeeze through a passage that's only 5 feet wide. While squeezing through a space, a
        creature
        must spend 1 extra foot for every foot it moves there, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity
        saving throws. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage while it's in the smaller space.
    </p>
    <h4 class="strong">Actions in Combat</h4>
    <p>
        When you take your action on your turn, you can take one of the actions presented here, an action you gained
        from your class or a special feature, or an action that you improvise. Many monsters have action options of
        their
        own in their stat blocks.
    </p>
    <p>When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the GM tells you whether that action is possible
        and what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to determine success or failure.</p>
    <h5 class="strong">Attack</h5>
    <p>The most common action to take in combat is the Attack action, whether you are swinging a sword, firing an arrow
        from a bow, or brawling with your fists.</p>
    <p>With this action, you make one melee or ranged attack. See the "Making an Attack" section for the rules that
        govern attacks.</p>
    <p>Certain features, such as the Extra Attack feature of the fighter, allow you to make more than one attack with
        this action.</p>
    <h5 class="strong">Cast a Spell</h5>
    <p>
        Spellcasters such as wizards and clerics, as well as many monsters, have access to spells and can use them to
        great effect in combat. Each spell has a casting time, which specifies whether the caster must use an action, a
        reaction, minutes, or even hours to cast the spell. Casting a spell is, therefore, not necessarily an action.
        Most spells do have a casting time of 1 action, so a spellcaster often uses his or her action in combat to cast
        such a spell.
    </p>
    <h5 class="strong">Dash</h5>
    <p>
        When you take the Dash action, you gain extra movement for the current turn. The increase equals your speed,
        after applying any modifiers. With a speed of 30 feet, for example, you can move up to 60 feet on your turn if
        you
        dash. Any increase or decrease to your speed changes this additional movement by the same amount. If your speed
        of 30 feet is reduced to 15 feet, for instance, you can move up to 30 feet this turn if you dash.
    </p>
    <h5 class="strong">Disengage</h5>
    <p>If you take the Disengage action, your movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks for the rest of the turn.</p>
    <h5 class="strong">Dodge</h5>
    <p>
        When you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on avoiding attacks. Until the start of your next turn, any
        attack roll made against you has disadvantage if you can see the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving throws
        with advantage. You lose this benefit if you are incapacitated (as explained in appendix A) or if your speed
        drops to 0.
    </p>
    <h5 class="strong">Help</h5>
    <p>
        You can lend your aid to another creature in the completion of a task. When you take the Help action, the
        creature you aid gains advantage on the next ability check it makes to perform the task you are helping with,
        provided
        that it makes the check before the start of your next turn.
    </p>
    <p>
        Alternatively, you can aid a friendly creature in attacking a creature within 5 feet of you. You feint, distract
        the target, or in some other way team up to make your ally's attack more effective. If your ally attacks the
        target before your next turn, the first attack roll is made with advantage.
    </p>
    <h5 class="strong">Hide</h5>
    <p>
        When you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check in an attempt to hide, following the rules
        for hiding. If you succeed, you gain certain benefits, as described in the "Unseen Attackers and Targets"
        section
        later in this chapter.
    </p>
    <h5 class="strong">Ready</h5>
    <p>
        Sometimes you want to get the jump on a foe or wait for a particular circumstance before you act. To do so, you
        can take the Ready action on your turn, which lets you act using your reaction before the start of your next
        turn.
    </p>
    <p>
        First, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your reaction. Then, you choose the action you will
        take in response to that trigger, or you choose to move up to your speed in response to it. Examples include
        "If the cultist steps on the trapdoor, I'll pull the lever that opens it," and "If the goblin steps next to me,
        I move away."
    </p>
    <p>When the trigger occurs, you can either take your reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore the
        trigger. Remember that you can take only one reaction per round.</p>
    <p>
        When you ready a spell, you cast it as normal but hold its energy, which you release with your reaction when the
        trigger occurs. To be readied, a spell must have a casting time of 1 action, and holding onto the spell's magic
        requires concentration. If your concentration is broken, the spell dissipates without taking effect. For
        example, if you are concentrating on the web spell and ready magic missile, your web spell ends, and if you take
        damage
        before you release magic missile with your reaction, your concentration might be broken.
    </p>
    <h5 class="strong">Search</h5>
    <p>When you take the Search action, you devote your attention to finding something. Depending on the nature of your
        search, the GM might have you make a Wisdom (Perception) check or an Intelligence (Investigation) check.</p>
    <h5 class="strong">Use an Object</h5>
    <p>
        You normally interact with an object while doing something else, such as when you draw a sword as part of an
        attack. When an object requires your action for its use, you take the Use an Object action. This action is also
        useful when you want to interact with more than one object on your turn.
    </p>
    <h4 class="strong">Making an Attack</h4>
    <p>Whether you're striking with a melee weapon, firing a weapon at range, or making an attack roll as part of a
        spell, an attack has a simple structure.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose a target.</strong> Pick a target within your attack's Range: a creature, an object, or a
            location.</li>
        <li>
            <strong>Determine modifiers.</strong> The GM determines whether the target has cover and whether you have
            advantage or disadvantage against the target. In addition, spells, special abilities, and other effects can
            apply
            penalties or bonuses to your attack roll.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Resolve the attack.</strong> You make the attack roll. On a hit, you roll damage, unless the
            particular attack has rules that specify otherwise. Some attacks cause special effects in addition to or
            instead of
            damage.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>If there's ever any question whether something you're doing counts as an attack, the rule is simple: if you're
        making an attack roll, you're making an attack.</p>
    <h5 class="strong">Attack Rolls</h5>
    <p>
        When you make an attack, your attack roll determines whether the attack hits or misses. To make an attack roll,
        roll a d20 and add the appropriate modifiers. If the total of the roll plus modifiers equals or exceeds the
        target's Armor Class (AC), the attack hits. The AC of a character is determined at character creation, whereas
        the AC of a monster is in its stat block.
    </p>
    <h5 class="strong">Modifiers to the Roll</h5>
    <p>
        When a character makes an attack roll, the two most common modifiers to the roll are an ability modifier and the
        character's proficiency bonus. When a monster makes an attack roll, it uses whatever modifier is provided in
        its stat block.
    </p>
