# Overview

The goal of this site, as a huge fan and player/DM of Dungeon's and Dragons (D&D), is to create something that I felt would be really handy and beneficial to supplement the game's experience. 

Dungon Club allows the user to achieve the following:
* Quickly look up Character Races/Classes/Spells and other rules/information, via a dataset created from the official D&D SRD. This is a free-use document for the creation of content based around the subject of D&D. 
* Choose from a list of official Source/Campaign books, with cover art, descriptions and links to purchase.
* Sign up for a secure account to gain access to a Profile area. This profile allows the user to create quick cards for all the characters for their games, and also a Quest To-Do list, to keep track of their in-game objectives. The site also has functionality to securely delete their account as they see fit.

# UI/UX

The wireframe for this site can be found in the submission_assets directory of the repository or at [this link.](https://github.com/mattingliscoding/code-institute-milestone-project-three/blob/master/submission_assets/matt-inglis-ms3-wireframe.pdf)

One of the first things I did was to try to find other websites that were doing a similar thing, with regard to displaying information from the D&D SRD. Many of the sites I found were lacking in any intuitive UI/UX choices and many looked extremely dated. However, one site I took great inspiration from was dndbeyond.com. They are a large company, that officially licenses D&D content and products in a scaled-up version of what I was aiming for with Dungeon Club.

I opted for a simple Bootstrap 4-oriented design, to focus on functionality and the maximising the easy access to the dataset, created via MongoDB Atlas. Due to the specified nature of the site, I wanted it to be simple and smooth for players of the game to arrive and instantly know where they needed to navigate to search for the information they needed for their gaming experience.

# Database

The dataset for this project is stored in a MongoDB Cluster, with 7 collections being accessed in three places across the site. Since MongoDB is a NoSQL service, there is no set schema for the dataset but I have broken the data up into two main categories as seen in this graphic: 

![Image of database graphic](https://i.imgur.com/4vjtqRF.png)

## Collections relevant to the game (D&D)
* **Races, Classes & Spells** - These collections are used in the 5th Edition Database Lookup page, where the user would go to find information to aid them in their playing or running the game of D&D. They are unrelated to the user's data and are publicly accessible with no authentication needed. The data is called via PyMongo and the Jinja templating language to populate the card on the page dynamically. You can see an example of the usage of this in this image: 

![Image of databse code example](https://i.imgur.com/4NaV4Js.png)

* **Books** - This dataset is purely standalone, and meant as a separate resource for players to see products available for the game, with details on pricing and a link to purchase.

## Collections relevant to the user

* **Users** - The user collection utilises password hashing via the security package installed with Werkzeug in Python. The two imported Werkzeug functions (generate_password_hash and check_password_hash) provide secure user authentication by storing secure passwords with salted hashes and later verifying an entered user password in plaintext against it's password hash to authenticate user.
In addition, via a Jinja loop, the User's "created_by" value is compared against the session.user result (session being a function imported from Flask) in order to ensure the custom Characters and Quests correllate and are showing to the correct user.

* **Characters & Quests** - The data in these collections are what the User is responsible for the addition, alteration and deletion of on the site and as such, this feature ensures that the Dungeon Club site can be considered as a CRUD project. As stated before, the "created_by" field is crucial in ensuring the User is being displayed the correct content they have created.

# Features
* **Navigation bar, with brand and page links (All pages)** - This header was created using Bootstrap, and gives the user a clear point of navigation control and is focused on ease-of-use. The collapse feature from Bootstrap also features heavily across the site, helping to keep the site expandable and accessible on smaller screens.
* **Hero Image (All pages)** - The consistent use of the 'hero' banner across the pages helps the site feel fluid and light-weight, by letting the user become accustomed to the familiar UI across all the pages.
* **Cards (All pages)** - The card and shadow classes from Bootstrap 4 adds a sense of dynamicism and depth to the UI, while also engaging in the 'Material' style of web design.
* **Home Page - News Section** - Links to current news in the sphere of D&D keep the site feeling up-to-date and alive.
* **5th Edition Database Page** - The sidebar menu drops down smoothly and intuitively, so as to not let the user get lost or confused in the longer menus. The list items in the menu are colour coded when hovered over or focused on to also help the user. On smaller screens, the menu changes to a middle position for smooth ease-of-use.
* **5th Edition Database Page - Data Populated Card** - The selection from the menu is triggering the respective function inside the Python app file, using Flask to query the database. The card on screen is then populated via loops using the Jinja templating language to display the stored information from the MongoDB collection for the chosen document.

* **Resources Page** - The cards on the resources page are once again utilising the Jinja loops to fetch and display the information for each of the products listed. The Jinja loops iterates over one Bootstrap Card Deck element in the HTML and fills the page with all the products available.
* **Profile Page - Quest To-Do App** - The feature to add a quest allows the user to keep a log of their games missions and objectives in a handy to-do format, using a Bootstrap form in a modal. The inputs are stored in a MongoDB collection and then redistributed to the drop-down card where the user can see their new quest, and edit/delete as they see fit.
* **Profile Page - Character Creation** - The 'Add Character' functionality allows the user to store their own characters/stats to be accessed easily and displayed neatly. I once more utilisted a Bootstrap card deck feature here that is populated with the information filled in from the HTML form. The Python function collects data from the form and stores it to be iterated over by the Jinja loop that fills out the cards, as can be seen in the following image:
![Screenshot of character cards](https://i.imgur.com/DmkO7O8.png)
* **Register/Login Pages** - These pages were designed intentionally simple to enable the user to access their profile as quickly as possible.
# Future Features 

With regards to the dataset used in the site from the D&D 5th Edition SRD, given the absolutely mammoth amount of data in the source documents, I used a curated subset of data aimed at fulfilling the goals of the assignment criteria. In the future, I aim to make this site a passion project and keep filling the database. 

Also in the future, I would like to add a public messageboard/forum application for the site, to move further into the field of social networking, with more in-depth user profiles.

## Code Validation & Known Errors
All HTML/CSS files for the site were formatted using [this free online formatter](https://www.freeformatter.com/html-formatter.html), then validated via [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/). The W3C check did spring some errors in the code but when checked through, they were all as a result of the bad functionality for validating Jinja Templating language, and any other errors were rectified.

The app.py Python file was checked and verified as completely PEP8 compliant, using [this checker](http://pep8online.com/checkresult):

## Browser Support and Functionality
The site was tested and working in several browsers; Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari and Microsoft Edge.

All site links, internal and external have been manually checked and tested thoroughly and no errors were found as a result of bad pathing.

## Responsive Design Testing
The site was extensively tested on a range of devices and screen-sizes, and was regularly tested during development, using Google Chrome DevTools. The range of responsive design can be seen in the prototype image at the top of this document but I will also include some screenshots from DevTools here from testing:
